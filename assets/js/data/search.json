Do you like data? Then you might like reading more about this project. Spoiler: it involves hockey, analytics, and a whole bunch of data engineering and data-science… A modern application of data-engineering and data-science on public Hockey (NHL) data for the purposes of learning &amp;amp; developmentTable of contents Introduction Architecture Setup Resources Developer contactIntroductionThe motivation behind this project was simple: make public hockey data available using modern technologies for the purposes of data-science &amp;amp; data-visualization. We wanted to be able to answer questions like… Which players are most likely to have a breakout season next year? Which draft prospects are most likely to succeed in the NHL? How many goals should we expect from elite players like Connor McDavid or Auston Matthews next season? Where on the ice are individual players most efficient with their shooting?ArchitectureIn order to get to this state of-course, a lot of data-engineering was necessary. Below is a visual representation of the project architecture.Data extractionCurrently, we only have a single source of data: the NHL Stats API. The Github repo that we built to extract the data is called tap-nhl. It is a Singer tap for the NHL Stats API.Built with the Meltano Tap SDK for Singer Taps.Below is a flow diagram explaining how it works:flowchart TDRoot[NHL Stats API] --&amp;gt;|Year| Seasons[Seasons]Root[NHL Stats API] --&amp;gt; Conferences[Conferences]Root[NHL Stats API] --&amp;gt; Divisions[Divisions]Root[NHL Stats API] --&amp;gt;|Year| Draft[Draft]Seasons[Seasons] --&amp;gt;|Season| Schedule[Schedule]Seasons[Seasons] --&amp;gt; |Season| Teams[Teams]Schedule[Schedule] --&amp;gt;|Game PK| Game[Game]Game[Game] --&amp;gt;|Game PK| Plays[Live Feed Plays]Game[Game] --&amp;gt;|Game PK| Linescore[Live Feed Linescore]Game[Game] --&amp;gt;|Game PK| Boxscore[Live Feed Boxscore]Teams[Teams] --&amp;gt; |Roster| Player[Players]Draft[Draft] --&amp;gt;|Prospect ID| Prospects[Prospects]Resources Repo: tap-nhlData transformation &amp;amp; loadingAll of this work is contained within a Github repo called dbt-nhl-breakouts and uses dbt to model our raw data. It contains the source code used to transform raw nhl data from the NHL Stats API into analysis-ready models.In other words, this is where the SQL magic happens using dbt. Ultimately, this work converts confusing raw data into: Data analyst/scientist friendly datasets all within one data warehouse (BigQuery) Well-documented tables, field definitions, and queries Reliable data that is tested and validated before ever making it into productionResources Repo: dbt-nhl-breakouts Documentation: dbt generated documentationData scienceConsider this section separate from the rest. Each question that we decide to answer of our newly modeled data will live in this bucket.

One beautiful summer morning, our founding members decided to hike Panorama Ridge altogether. At some point on the car-ride, one of the members told a story from his childhood.He recounted that as a little kid, his mother would always rub this clear-looking cream on his face and upper body. The cream supposedly helped open up the nasal cavities and promoted breathing when he had a stuffy nose. The name of the product was, you guessed it, bicks-bapa-roob.A few years later, he was developing a stuffy nose while at a friend’s house for a sleepover. Naturally, he asked the friend if he had any of the good stuff to help with his breathing. The friend looked at him as though he was crazy, and said he wasn’t sure and had never heard of such a product. The friend asked his dad if they had any and he was basically like, “wtf”.A few minutes go by and the friend’s mom comes down saying they didn’t have any bicks-bapa-roob, but that they had this rub that was supposedly good for this sort of thing. VaporRub. By Vicks. Vicks. VaporRub. Bicks Bapa Roob.It was at THAT moment, that he realized he had been duped by his mother’s Mexican accent. The worst part, however, was that his father - who was born and raised in Vancouver, BC - was intentionally mispronouncing it.The group chuckled over the story, and a legend was born." } ]
